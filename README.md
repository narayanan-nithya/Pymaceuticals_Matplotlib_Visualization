# Observations and Insights

1. The Drugs namely 'Capomulin' and "Ramicane' had the most data points meaning study was conducted with more mice subjected      to these drugs.

2. The male mice gender comprises of the 50.6% of the 250 mice under study.

3. It is evident from the quartile calculations that the tumor size in the mice tested with Capomulin Drug has significantly      reduced over the period of the 45 days. It is also evident that even the upper range outliers have small tumor volume as      compared to Ramicane, Infobulin and Ceftamin.

4. As the tumor volume increases ,the weight increases and as the tumor volume decreases, thus the weight decreases showing a    positive correlation. This is also evident from the correlation factor of 0.87 as calculated.
